Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) are both popular techniques for topic modeling, but they have different underlying principles and are suitable for different scenarios. Let's explore their differences and when to use each:

### Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

1. **Probabilistic Model:** 
   - LDA is based on probabilistic graphical models. It assumes that documents are a mixture of topics and that topics are a mixture of words. The model tries to backtrack from the documents to find a set of topics that are likely to have generated the documents.

2. **Generative Process:** 
   - LDA assumes a generative process for documents: each document is thought to be created by randomly selecting a set of topics and then randomly selecting words from those topics.

3. **Use Cases:**
   - LDA is generally preferred when the relationship between topics and documents is more complex and probabilistic in nature.
   - It is well-suited for cases where you can assume that documents are produced from a mixture of topics.

### Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

1. **Linear Algebra Approach:** 
   - NMF is a matrix factorization technique based on linear algebra. It factorizes a data matrix into two matrices with the constraint that all three matrices have no negative elements.

2. **Parts-based Representation:** 
   - NMF is often used for its ability to provide a parts-based representation because it allows only additive, not subtractive, combinations. This can lead to more interpretable components, especially when the data naturally does not contain negative values.

3. **Use Cases:**
   - NMF is typically used when the data is non-negative and the additive nature of the factorization aligns well with the interpretation of the data.
   - It is preferred in scenarios like image processing, text mining where a parts-based representation is more meaningful.

### When to Use LDA vs NMF:

1. **Data Nature:**
   - Use NMF when your data is additive (like pixel values in images, word counts in documents) and non-negative.
   - Use LDA when you are dealing with probabilistic distributions, like when each document can be a mixture of multiple topics.

2. **Interpretability:**
   - If you need a more interpretable model (where features/components directly add up to form the original data), NMF can be more suitable.
   - LDA provides a more holistic and probabilistic view of how topics are distributed across documents.

3. **Performance and Complexity:**
   - The performance of each method can vary depending on the specific dataset and requirements. It's often beneficial to try both methods and compare their results.
   - LDA can be more computationally intensive due to its probabilistic nature.

In practice, the choice between LDA and NMF can also depend on the specific requirements of your project and how the assumptions of each model align with your data. It's not uncommon to experiment with both to see which yields better results for your particular application.
